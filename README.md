This GitHub repository contains all Jupyter Notebook files, HTML files, and PNG files authored by Barnett Yang relevant to this study.

Due to Github file size limits, none of the publicly available data downloaded for this study is included in this Github repository. As a solution to this, note that the file `paths.txt` contains the directory and file tree for this project as well as URLs from which one could download the relevant data. Simply replicate the file tree with the correct data files and the pandas `read_csv` functions in the Jupyter Notebook files will run correctly, allowing you to manipulate the notebooks and analyze the relevant data yourself.
